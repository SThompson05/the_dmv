# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.

Reflection
Before moving on to the next portion of this iteration, reflect on your process of learning a new codebase. Take notes on the following questions so that you can speak to these themes at the end of the project:

** Please add the below reflections to your Mod 1 Project Reflections gist within the Second Solo Project section. **

Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.
What was hard about working with code you did not write?
What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?
